# Danie Sankey — Website

A cinematic, full-screen photography portfolio: every section is a full-bleed photo with a title and a "View Work →" link, plus a floating text nav at the top of the screen.

Cinematic touches: an opening title card (once per visit), letterbox bars that open on each page and close between pages, film grain, a vignette and colour grade, serif title cards that resolve letter by letter, a viewfinder scene counter and timecode, and wipe-in reveals on the Work and Gallery pages. Visitors who've turned on "reduce motion" get a calm, static version.

## Make it yours

Edit **one file**: [`assets/js/content.js`](assets/js/content.js). It holds:

- your name (shown as the logo in the middle of the nav), phone, email, location, and social links
- the About text, Investment packages, and Clients list and testimonials
- the photo categories (Lifestyle, Portraits, …). Each one is a full-screen section on the home page and gets its own gallery page. Add, remove, rename, or reorder them freely.

## Adding photos

Drop your images into `images/` at the paths listed in `content.js`, for example:

```
images/about.jpg
images/lifestyle/cover.jpg     ← full-screen home section
images/lifestyle/01.jpg … 06.jpg  ← gallery
```

Until a photo exists, that spot shows a dark gradient, so the site never looks broken.
You can upload photos at full size, straight from a camera or phone. Each time the site publishes, it automatically resizes the published copies to at most 2400px and compresses them (about 0.2–0.8 MB each), so the site stays fast. GitHub's web uploader accepts files up to 25 MB.

## Pages

| Page | File |
| --- | --- |
| Home (full-screen sections) | `index.html` |
| Portfolio (all categories) | `work.html` |
| Category gallery + lightbox | `gallery.html?c=<slug>` |
| About | `about.html` |
| Investment (packages; prices optional) | `investment.html` |
| Clients (client names and testimonials) | `clients.html` |
| Contact (opens the visitor's email app) | `contact.html` |

## Hosting

Deployed to GitHub Pages by [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) on every push.
Live at **https://sankeymwakingwe.github.io/daniesankey/**

One-time setup (repo owner):
1. Settings → General → Danger Zone → **Change visibility** → Public (free Pages needs a public repo).
2. Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: **GitHub Actions**.
3. Actions tab → "Deploy site to GitHub Pages" → **Run workflow** (or just push a change).

## Fonts

The logo uses **Quincy CF** and the navigation and body text use **Sofia Pro**, both served by Adobe Fonts through the web kit "DanieSankey website" (`ann1gwy`) in your Adobe Fonts account. The kit only serves fonts on the domains listed in it (currently `sankeymwakingwe.github.io` and `localhost`). If you move the site to your own domain, add that domain to the kit at https://fonts.adobe.com/my_fonts#web_projects-section.
